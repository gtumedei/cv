  \textbf{PhD Programme}: Computer Science and Engineering, Cycle 39

  \textbf{Research topic}: Exploring Human-Digital Twin Interaction to Enhance Awareness and Promote Sustainability

  \textbf{Description}: The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of different interaction modalities in conveying information coming from Digital Twin (DT) systems to their users. Classic user interfaces, eXtended Reality (XR), voice commands, generative AI, and more are going to be explored to meaningfully visualize and manipulate DT data. By focusing on some case studies, mainly about smart environment digital twins, and applying Human-Computer Interaction methods, the goal is to find out how the human-DT interface can positively impact awareness, improving aspects like infrastructure management and decision-making processes and promoting sustainability. Findings will be generalized into guidelines on effectively conveying and manipulating with DT data to increase people's awareness across diverse fields of interest.

    \item[] \textbf{Subjects}: Web Services and Applications
    \item[] \textbf{Supervisor}: Prof. Catia Prandi
    \item[] \textbf{Description}: Documentation of the AlmaMap Navile project, a system that powers public touch kiosks across the Navile district of the University of Bologna, offering two main features: i) maps and wayfinding to help people in orienting themselves; and ii) real-time environmental data and comfort level about campus spaces, obtained by interfacing with the BIM system installed at the complex. The end result is a first step towards building a smart campus Digital Twin, that can support all the people who are part of the campus life in their daily activities, improving their experience, giving them the ability to make informed decisions, and promoting awareness and sustainability.
