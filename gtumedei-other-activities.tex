  \textbf{Project}: H2020\_SMARTLAGOON\newline
  \textbf{Subject}: Designing Digital Twin interfaces and Data Visualization for increasing the stakeholders' awareness in the SMARTLAGOON context\newline
  \textbf{Description}: The project related to this position is within the context of the H2020 FET SMARTLAGOON, with the main objective of developing the Mar Menor digital twin that can predict future problems and provide stakeholders with a tool for sustainable decision-making. The motivation behind this approach is that coastal lagoons are ecosystems of great environmental and socio-economic value; however, they are also particularly vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanisation due to tourism development. The vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems require a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental interrelationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources can provide a mechanism for finding new solutions to assess the trade-offs between socio-economic and environmental aspects. Such solutions must be based on the analysis of data from different sources, both social (e.g. reports and questionnaires, social-media, legislation) and physical (e.g. meteorological, historical). The analysis can be carried out through the creation of a digital twin. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the data and the large volume, it becomes essential to design the digital twin's interfaces in such a way that the data is comprehensible to the various stakeholders.
